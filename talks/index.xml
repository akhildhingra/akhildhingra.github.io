      <description>I gave the talk at Spark-AI 2019 edition. Excerpt from my session in the enterprise segment:
Zalando SE is Europe&amp;rsquo;s leading online fashion platform and connects customers, brands and partners. With millions of visitors each month, we have petabytes of purchase, click-stream, product and other data in our data lake. This data is crucial to powering insights on shopper behavior and driving an AI-first strategy to improve site engagement.
Over 7 months ago, Zalando adopted Apache Spark, Delta Lake and Databricks as its de-facto computation platform for analytics and machine learning.</description>

      <description>Please join me at Product Camp / Bar Camp (2nd Sep 2020, Europe) for my talk about Build vs Buy vs Vendor Managed:
Solving an internal customer need often requires PMs to choose between Build vs Buy. For platform centric offerings in enterprises like Data Transformation / Machine Learning, there is a third option â€“ Vendor Managed. Within large microservices footprint and complex org structures, much of the initial procurement and product discovery happens with key stakeholders and limited beta users.</description>
